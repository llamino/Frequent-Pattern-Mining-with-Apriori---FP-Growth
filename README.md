# Frequent Pattern Mining with Apriori & FP-Growth
 This project implements Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for frequent pattern mining and association rule generation. It processes transactional datasets to discover frequent itemsets and extract insights using support and confidence thresholds. Both algorithms are optimized for performance and usability in real-world data mining tasks.
